The scripts folder contains the scripts usable with the software:
- room.bhv : script for a single room environment
- paper_script.bhv : script for a multi-room environment
The program runs with both the scripts, just remember to change the name of the dataset file when changin environment, if you want to not override it.
It is possible to change it in the datasetManager\src\iCasa\dataset\manager\datasetManagerImpl.java file.
